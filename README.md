# AudioLED
Visualize music using Intel DE10 Standard developement board. 


The idea behind this project is to use Altera FFT IP core along with WS2812B led strip to visualize
audio input (from an input jack on the DE 10 Standard development board).

All the source files are located in the /bin directory. 
There is a documentation available in Polish in the /docs directory.
